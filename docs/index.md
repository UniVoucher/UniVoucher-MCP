## How UniVoucher Works

At a high level, UniVoucher works through these basic steps:

1. **Card Creation**: A user connects their wallet, selects a token, enters an amount, and creates a gift card. The platform generates a secure card ID and secret.

2. **Card Distribution**: The creator shares the card ID and secret with the recipient through their preferred communication channel.

3. **Card Redemption**: The recipient enters the card ID and secret, connecting their wallet to receive the funds.

4. **Card Management**: Creators can view and manage their cards, including canceling unredeemed cards to reclaim funds.

Under the hood, UniVoucher uses a unique cryptographic approach to ensure security without requiring pre-registration of recipients. More details can be found in the [Card Security](technical/card-security.md) section.
