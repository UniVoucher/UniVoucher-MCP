# Disclaimer

## Beta Version Notice

UniVoucher is currently in beta version and was recently deployed. We've taken extensive measures to ensure security and reliability, but as with any new blockchain protocol, users should be aware that this is an early release.

## Bug Reporting

Users may encounter bugs or unexpected behavior. We encourage you to report any issues through our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/UniVoucherOfficial), which can help improve the platform for everyone.

## Smart Contract Risks

Using blockchain smart contracts inherently carries risks. While our contracts have undergone extensive review, no code is completely immune to potential vulnerabilities. Users should understand this inherent risk when using any blockchain application.

!!! warning "Risk Awareness"
    All blockchain applications carry inherent risks. Always use caution and only commit funds you can afford to lose.

## Security Commitment

We are committed to contract security and have implemented multiple security measures. Our contracts prioritize user safety and fund security.

## Card Secret Loss

!!! danger "keep card secrets safe and secure."
    If a card secret is lost, funds can only be restored through card cancellation by the creator. UniVoucher cannot recover lost secrets or access funds.
 

## Abandoned Card Policy

To prevent permanent fund loss, all cards include an abandonment protection mechanism. If a card remains unredeemed and uncanceled for 5 years, it's considered abandoned. ONLY at that point, UniVoucher (as contract owner) will gain the right to cancel it and claim the funds. Before 5 years, no one, not even the UniVoucher contract owner, can cancel the card except the card creator.

!!! info "Abandonment process"
    - Cards inactive for 5 years are considered abandoned
    - The abandonment date is displayed on the card details
    - Before 5 years, no one, not even the UniVoucher contract owner, can cancel the card except the card creator.
